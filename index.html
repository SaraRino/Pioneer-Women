      <h2>Sarah (Reed) Heryford</h2>
      <p>Sarah Reed married Paul Heryford in Franklin County, Tennessee, in August, 1810. They had 11 children, one of whom died in infancy. Paul, along with one of his sons and one of his daughters and their families, decided to travel to California on the Oregon Trail in 1857. He died of <q>congestive chill</q> two months after arriving in Milleville, California. Sarah was devastated and cried that she wanted to go home to Missouri. She remained in California for another year. Her son, Clemmens Heryford, took her by wagon from Milleville to San Francisco, where, <em>at the age of 65</em>, she boarded a ship and sailed to Panama. She rode a mule through the isthmus of Panama, then boarded another ship and sailed to New Orleans, Louisiana. She then boarded a river boat and sailed north on the Mississippi River to Quincy, Illinois, where her son, James Heryford, met her and took her home. They traveled by wagon back to Greensburg, Missouri, where she lived the rest of her life. Sarah died in 1879 at the age of 87.</p>

      <h2>Lillian (Marvin) Heryford</h2>
      <p>Lillie Mae Marvin was born in 1872 in Rutledge County, Missouri. She married Perry Crosswhite Heryford on January 26, 1900, and they had four children. Perry and Lillie divorced in 1909. Perry kidnapped his second son shortly after the divorce, and they went to California. Lille and her sister, Allie Marvin, took the three kids and moved to a homestead 50 miles northeast of Sturgis, South Dakota, in Meade County, where they lived for two years. Lillie and Allie made the required improvements and were granted the homestead in 1912. The property was sold, and the family moved back to Delmont, South Dakota, where they lived until 1911 when Lillie married James Stamper in Colorado. They made their home on a ranch north of Arapahoe, Colorado, in Cheyenne County. Lillie Stamper died in Cheyenne Wells, Colorado in 1959 at the age of 86.</p>
